Accordingly, seeing that our senses sometimes deceive us, I was willing to supp

se that there existed nothing really such as they presented to us; And because 

ome men err in reasoning, and fall into Paralogisms, even on the simplest matte

s of Geometry, I, convinced that I was as open to error as any other, rejected 

s false all the reasonings I had hitherto taken for Demonstrations; And finally

 when I considered that the very same thoughts (presentations) which we experie

ce when awake may also be experienced when we are asleep, while there is at tha

 time not one of them true, I supposed that all the objects (presentations) tha

 had ever entered into my mind when awake, had in them no more truth than the i

lusions of my dreams. But immediately upon this I observed that, whilst I thus 

ished to think that all was false, it was absolutely necessary that I, who thus

thought, should be something; And as I observed that this truth, I think, there

ore I am,[c] was so certain and of such evidence that no ground of doubt, howev

r extravagant, could be alleged by the Sceptics capable of shaking it, I conclu

ed that I might, without scruple, accept it as the first principle of the philo

ophy of which I was in search.
